Step 1: Project Setup and OBD-II Connection

*Set up the Maven project with the necessary dependencies (JavaFX, OBD2, persistence library, etc.).
*Create the basic project structure (folders, packages, main classes).
*Implement Bluetooth connection to the OBD-II interface.
*Handle connection errors and display clear error messages to the user.

Step 2: Reading and Clearing Error Codes

*Implement reading of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) using the Mode03 command from the OBD2 library.
*Display DTCs in the user interface with their descriptions.
*Implement clearing of DTCs using the Mode04 command.
*Confirm DTC clearing and update the display.

Step 3: Real-Time Data Display

*Create the JavaFX view for the dashboard (DashboardView).
*Implement real-time data reading (speed, RPM, temperature, etc.) using appropriate OBD2 commands.
*Display real-time data on the dashboard with graphs and gauges.
*Allow the user to customize the dashboard by choosing which data to display.

Step 4: ECU Mapping and Stage Management

*Create the JavaFX view for stage management (StageView).
*Implement reading and writing of ECU parameters.
*Define several performance stages with specific ECU parameters.
*Allow the user to select and apply a stage.

Step 5: Data Logging and Analysis

*Choose a data storage method (database or file).
*Implement saving of diagnostic data and changes made to the vehicle.
*Create a JavaFX view to display the history of saved data.
*Develop data analysis tools (graphs, statistics, etc.).
*Integrate analysis tools into the user interface.

Step 6: Finalization and Improvements

*Implement error and exception handling throughout the application.
*Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
*Document the code and API for easier maintenance and evolution.
*Improve the user interface based on user feedback.
