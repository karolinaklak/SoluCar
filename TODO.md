# Step 1: Project Setup and OBD-II Connection

* ** #1 ** Set up the Maven project with the necessary dependencies (JavaFX, OBD2, persistence library, etc.).
* ** #2 ** Create the basic project structure (folders, packages, main classes).
* ** #3 ** Implement Bluetooth connection to the OBD-II interface.
* ** #4 ** Handle connection errors and display clear error messages to the user.

# Step 2: Reading and Clearing Error Codes

* ** #5 ** Implement reading of diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) using the Mode03 command from the OBD2 library.
* ** #6 ** Display DTCs in the user interface with their descriptions.
* ** #7 ** Implement clearing of DTCs using the Mode04 command.
* ** #8 ** Confirm DTC clearing and update the display.

# Step 3: Real-Time Data Display

* ** #9 ** Create the JavaFX view for the dashboard (DashboardView).
* ** #10 ** Implement real-time data reading (speed, RPM, temperature, etc.) using appropriate OBD2 commands.
* ** #11 ** Display real-time data on the dashboard with graphs and gauges.
* ** #12 ** Allow the user to customize the dashboard by choosing which data to display.

# Step 4: ECU Mapping and Stage Management

* ** #13 ** Create the JavaFX view for stage management (StageView).
* ** #14 ** Implement reading and writing of ECU parameters.
* ** #15 ** Define several performance stages with specific ECU parameters.
* ** #16 ** Allow the user to select and apply a stage.

# Step 5: Data Logging and Analysis

* ** #17 ** Choose a data storage method (database or file).
* ** #18 ** Implement saving of diagnostic data and changes made to the vehicle.
* ** #19 ** Create a JavaFX view to display the history of saved data.
* ** #20 ** Develop data analysis tools (graphs, statistics, etc.).
* ** #21 ** Integrate analysis tools into the user interface.

# Step 6: Finalization and Improvements

* ** #22 ** Implement error and exception handling throughout the application.
* ** #23 ** Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
* ** #24 ** Document the code and API for easier maintenance and evolution.
* ** #25 ** Improve the user interface based on user feedback.
